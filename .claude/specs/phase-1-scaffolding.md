# Phase 1: Scaffolding

## Objective

Establish the foundational project structure with pnpm + Turborepo, implementing the AI-governed monorepo architecture.

## Key Requirements

- Set up pnpm workspace with Turborepo configuration
- Create shared packages: @repo/types, @repo/utils, @repo/config
- Establish TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality
- Set up basic CI/CD pipeline structure

## Success Criteria

- All packages build successfully with `pnpm build`
- Type checking passes with `pnpm typecheck`
- Linting passes with `pnpm lint`
- Project structure follows monorepo conventions

## Focus Areas

- Package dependency management
- Build system configuration
- Development tooling setup
- Code quality enforcement
