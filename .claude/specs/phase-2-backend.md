# Phase 2: Backend Infrastructure

## Objective

Implement the serverless signaling backbone using Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects for room management and peer coordination.

## Key Requirements

- Create Cloudflare Worker with Durable Objects for room state management
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- Design room lifecycle management (creation, joining, leaving)
- Implement peer discovery and signaling protocol
- Set up authentication and authorization

## Success Criteria

- Workers can handle room creation and management
- WebSocket connections establish successfully
- Peer signaling works for WebRTC handshake
- Room state persists across Worker restarts
- Authentication system validates users

## Focus Areas

- Durable Objects state management
- WebSocket message handling
- WebRTC signaling protocol
- Room persistence and cleanup
- Security and rate limiting
