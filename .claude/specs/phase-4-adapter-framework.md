# Phase 4: Adapter Framework

## Objective

Develop the video site adapter framework with initial implementations for YouTube, Netflix, and Disney+ using the standardized adapter interface.

## Key Requirements

- Design abstract adapter interface for video site integration
- Implement YouTube adapter with DOM manipulation
- Implement Netflix adapter with video element detection
- Implement Disney+ adapter with platform-specific controls
- Create adapter registry and dynamic loading system
- Establish video state detection and control APIs

## Success Criteria

- All three adapters successfully detect video elements
- Video state (play/pause/seek) can be read and controlled
- Adapter framework supports dynamic site detection
- State synchronization works across different video sites
- Error handling gracefully manages adapter failures

## Focus Areas

- Abstract adapter interface design
- DOM manipulation strategies
- Video element detection patterns
- State extraction and control methods
- Cross-site compatibility testing
