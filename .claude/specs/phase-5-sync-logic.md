# Phase 5: Synchronization Logic

## Objective

Implement the core synchronization engine with WebRTC Data Channels, conflict resolution, and flexible control modes.

## Key Requirements

- Establish WebRTC Data Channel connections between peers
- Implement synchronization protocol with timestamp-based coordination
- Create conflict resolution algorithms for competing state changes
- Develop flexible control modes (host-only, democratic, turn-based)
- Implement buffering and latency compensation
- Create synchronization health monitoring

## Success Criteria

- WebRTC Data Channels establish reliably between peers
- Video synchronization maintains <200ms drift
- Conflict resolution handles simultaneous state changes
- All control modes function correctly
- Synchronization recovers from network interruptions
- Performance metrics track sync quality

## Focus Areas

- WebRTC Data Channel management
- Synchronization protocol design
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Control mode implementations
- Network resilience and recovery
- Performance optimization
